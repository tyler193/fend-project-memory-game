## Instructions

--
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

Steps to Play:

2) Match the eight pairs of 2 on the board.
3) Once all matches are made, either choose to play again or close modal popup.
4) If you want to restart before finishing, click restart button in top right.
